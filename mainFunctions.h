	Program: Geometric calculation library
	
	Description: The geometric calculation library provides a MATLAB callable
	functions to compute the vertex enumeration, facet enumeration and projection
	for convex polyhedra. In addition it provides functions to compute minimal
	representations of convex polyhedra. The geometric library uses the LRS library,
	see http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html for details.
